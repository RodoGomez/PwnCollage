# Babyshell level 2

## Restrictions

The only thing that changes between this challenge and the level 1, is that this time, your shellcode is injected into the stack of the process, instead of a mapped memory.

The solution provided in the Level 1 works the same for this one, in fact, any solution that does not hard-code any memory address will work.
