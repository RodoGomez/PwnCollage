# Babyshell level 3

## Restrictions

This level applies a filter to your shellcode, if your shellcode contains the character 'H' it wont pass the filter. Remember that your shellcode consist of a series of bytes that the CPU interprets as machine instructions, but at the same time those bytes can be interpreted as their respective ASCII character value.

## Hints

Understand the opcodes generated by your assembly instructions.
