## What is pwn.collage?

As stated on their web site: 

> pwn.college is a first-stage education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. It is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) CTFs and wargames. The philosophy of pwn.college is “practice makes perfect”.

In my opinion, pwn.collage is an amazing resource for learning hacking and cybersecurity concepts and skills related to vulnerabilty research and explotaition, binary exploitation, reverse engineering and more. 

pwn.collage has its own YouTube channel where classes are uploaded in order to learn and study the concepts through all the modules it has. But not only that, it has its own platform for you to go and practice all the skills you are learning.!

## Important.!

The goal of this repo is not to provide you with an easy way to go when you are trying to solve any of the challenges from pwn.collage. 

You should use this resource as **YOUR LAST RESOURCE**. I encourage you to try your best when solving the challenges, try to go beyond your limits because that's the only way you will really improve your skills and knowledge.

Every challenge in this repo will have its respective README file. **In that file I'll be leaving hints** about how to solve the challenge. You can use them before reading the actual solution.

I hope you enjoy learning at pwn.collage as much as I'm doing.
